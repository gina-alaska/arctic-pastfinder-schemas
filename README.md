# Arctic Pastfinder Schemas

This is a repository to hold the various schema definitions for the resources of the Arctic Pastfinder project.

Each resource will be it's own subdirectory with at least a schema.json that contains the schema definitions and an example.json file giving a real example of a resource instance.
